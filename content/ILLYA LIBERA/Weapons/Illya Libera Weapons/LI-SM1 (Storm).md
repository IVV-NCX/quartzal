# Libera SMG Model 1 (Storm)
The SM1 is designed for quickly wiping out targets with efficiency and stealth. The subsonic rounds, combined with a built in suppressor, makes for a quiet, undetectable firing. Including a folding stock, minimalist frame, and detachable barrel, this gun can go anywhere without showing it's presence. A 3 round burst, in combination with specialized training, gives soldiers the capability for a deadly instant kill, with no waste of bullets.

## LI-SM2
The SM2 is not a direct improvement, but rather, a modified suite for suppressive fire. Exchanging the suppressor out for a muzzle break, and changing the burst fire mechanism out for a energy cycling mechanism. By putting a battery and heat converter into the stock, each shot is charged with energy, improving suppressive fire and dealing more anti-energy damage.

## LI-SM3
The SM3 realizes that the energy within each shot was too insignificant to matter against modernized shields. The bullet charger was removed, and converted to an energy grenade launcher, utilizing the converted energy to fire, or charge energy grenades.
