D&D is a classic fantasy, with swords and magic, elves and sometimes guns.
Lancer is a more futuristic robot combat game. Easy to play, but with modular designs.

---- 
This TTRPG is about a universal, customizable world of guns and magic. 

# STYLE
MODULAR - The system is reasonable with rules, and where possible, of little blocks that can be exchanged out for others. For instance, levels (1-25) should be broken into 5 parts, that can be exchanged for others (if not too cumbersome), or weight rules should have alternatives. 

ENDLESS DESIGN - Character creation can take hours and hours, endless choices. Skill trees, customizability, and universal resources should give easy access to multiclassing, balanced homebrew, and more. 

MEDIUM-HIGH POWER - You can kill god. But it'll cost you everything. You're better off fighting armies at your strongest.

SIMPLE COMBAT - Endless spells should be tied together with simple fighting. Roll for damage, roll to dodge. No excessive stats, no weird rules. It should make it so fighting is more "wait what did this guy to do his spells again", over "what do I do when XX happens?"

CUSTOMIZABLE - Like what MODULAR said. It's easy to homebrew, or design balanced stuff.

# CORE RULES
Rolls: Round down for all decimals.

Checks: Roll above the difficulty for success. Add relevant stats, for instance, strength when breaking down a door. Automatic success if STAT divided by 2 is higher than difficulty. For instance, if you have a STR of 16, you can break a door with DIFFICULTY 8 or lower. Default difficulty is D12.

Damage & Hits: Roll D12 to hit. Add total

# EXPERTISE
An expertise is like a background of sorts. You gain 1 point when you make a character, and 1 for every 3 levels.

NIGHTWALKER
	You found way to hide yourself amidst the shadows, living without presence. Everyone deep underground greets you as their own.
