This world is set in a far-future world. Mechas, plasma rifles, cyborgs. Most people's dreams are to become a governor, an official for "illya libera".

Unlike most "Cyberpunk" scenarios, illya libera is relatively peaceful, non-corrupt, and benevolent. However, due to their large interplanetary scale, illya neglects various poor cities, off to rot away for them to replace.

## Technology
Most "crawlers", as illya describes, use combination firearms, capable of using both explosive rounds (bullets) and capacitor load. More rich and powerful users use gauss rifles, which fire tiny slivers of metal out using a heavy energy load, combining the advantages of both weapons. 

While there are just as many magic users, due to their inherent magic levels (and the great pay), they tend to lean toward government jobs
