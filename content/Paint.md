## PRIMERS: Choose 1
- TAMIYA GREY PRIMER 180ml spray can (13.5, Amazon)
*Doesn't come off easily w/ IPA.*
- VALLEJO GREY PRIMER 400ml spray can ($21, Walmart, free shipping)
*Comes off better w/ IPA.*

## WASHES: Buy all
- NULN OIL
- Agrax Earthshade
- Ardcoat/ Gloss Varnish (satin is fine, but gloss will give shine. Used to protect.) - MIGHT NOT USE

*Buying wash normally is like $13, plus shipping. Pretty expensive for watered down paint. Making own is a tad of an investment, but might be worth it. Matte medium is $10-20 for a bottle, although I shouldn't use much of it. Dish soap also works, but I'm a tad suspicious about that.*

# PROCESS
*The process of painting is a varied one. From Citadel's methods, to Trovian's, they're widely varied in many ways. This will be my reference for my style.*

V1 of process:

STEP 1: PRIME

STEP 2: BASE COLORS - Apply "base colors" to all parts of the mini. Red on red armor, black on black boots, flesh on flesh.

STEP 3: BASIC WASH - Apply wash across mini, focusing on darker (seen from under) areas. Make sure to cover major details zones as well, but apply lightly.

STEP 4: SECONDARY COLORS - Apply secondary colors, adding more details and depth.

STEP 5: TERTAIRY COLORS - Apply tertiary colors.

STEP 6: BASIC HIGHLIGHTS - Apply highlights across lighter (seen from above). Add contrast to major detail zones.

STEP 7: EDGE HIGHLIGHTS - Apply highlights at edges.

STEP 8: SECONDARY WASH - Applying a second layer of wash over the previously washed paint will give more depth - apply more lightly.

STEP 9: APPLY FINAL DETAILS -

STEP 10: WEATHER
