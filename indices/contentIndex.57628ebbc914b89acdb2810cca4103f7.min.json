The subsonic rounds, combined with a built in suppressor, makes for a quiet, undetectable firing. Including a folding stock, minimalist frame, and detachable barrel, this gun can go anywhere without showing it's presence. A 3 round burst, in combination with specialized training, gives soldiers the capability for a deadly instant kill, with no waste of bullets.\n\n## LI-SM2\nThe SM2 is not a direct improvement, but rather, a modified suite for suppressive fire. Exchanging the suppressor out for a muzzle break, and changing the burst fire mechanism out for a energy cycling mechanism. By putting a battery and heat converter into the stock, each shot is charged with energy, improving suppressive fire and dealing more anti-energy damage.\n\n## LI-SM3\nThe SM3 realizes that the energy within each shot was too insignificant to matter against modernized shields. The bullet charger was removed, and converted to an energy grenade launcher, utilizing the converted energy to fire, or charge energy grenades.\n\n| Model  | Range | Damage | Traits                                               | Tags             |\n| ------ | ----- | ------ | ---------------------------------------------------- | ---------------- |\n| LI-SM1 | 4     | 3x2    | +1 to hiding this weapon.                            | Suppressed       |\n| LI-SM2 | 4     | 3x2+1  | Damage bonus is electric damage.                     |                  |\n| LI-SM3 | 4     | 3x2    | Can charge an electric grenade after firing 5 times. | Grenade launcher |\n\n\n*Writing notes: I want Ponzu to be tired, but active.*\n## Log: Rookie squad, Ponzu; CQB Tactics\n\nTest Administrators: Ponzu of \"Mayonnaise Squad\", Takoyaki of \"Mayonnaise Squad\" \n\n\n\"Ok, ok.

Easy to play, but with modular designs.\n\n---- \nThis TTRPG is about a universal, customizable world of guns and magic. \n\n# STYLE\nMODULAR - The system is reasonable with rules, and where possible, of little blocks that can be exchanged out for others. For instance, levels (1-25) should be broken into 5 parts, that can be exchanged for others (if not too cumbersome), or weight rules should have alternatives. \n\nENDLESS DESIGN - Character creation can take hours and hours, endless choices. Skill trees, customizability, and universal resources should give easy access to multiclassing, balanced homebrew, and more. \n\nMEDIUM-HIGH POWER - You can kill god. But it'll cost you everything. You're better off fighting armies at your strongest.\n\nSIMPLE COMBAT - Endless spells should be tied together with simple fighting. Roll for damage, roll to dodge. No excessive stats, no weird rules. It should make it so fighting is more \"wait what did this guy to do his spells again\", over \"what do I do when XX happens?\"\n\nCUSTOMIZABLE - Like what MODULAR said. It's easy to homebrew, or design balanced stuff.\n\n---\n# STYLE\n\n\n---\n\n# CORE RULES\nRolls: Round down for all decimals.\n\nChecks: Roll above the difficulty for success. Add relevant stats, for instance, strength when breaking down a door. Automatic success if STAT divided by 2 is higher than difficulty. For instance, if you have a STR of 16, you can break a door with DIFFICULTY 8 or lower. Default difficulty is D12.\n\nDamage \u0026 Hits: Roll D12 to hit. Add total \n\n---\n\n# EXPERTISE\nAn expertise is like a background of sorts. You gain 1 point when you make a character, and 1 for every 3 levels.\n\nNIGHTWALKER\n\tYou found way to hide yourself amidst the shadows, living without presence. Everyone deep underground greets you as their own.\n\n","lastmodified":"2022-10-25T01:46:49.765922938Z","tags":null},"/Paint":{"title":"","content":"## PRIMERS: Choose 1\n- TAMIYA GREY PRIMER 180ml spray can (13.5, Amazon)\n*Doesn't come off easily w/ IPA.*\n- VALLEJO GREY PRIMER 400ml spray can ($21, Walmart, free shipping)\n*Comes off better w/ IPA.*\n\n## WASHES: Buy all\n- NULN OIL\n- Agrax Earthshade\n- Ardcoat/ Gloss Varnish (satin is fine, but gloss will give shine.
